My research interests include many fields related to computer vision and machine learning, currently I'm focusing on semantic image segmentation, especially in a semi-supervised or weakly-supervised setting.

As for my personal life, I'm an excellent GO player(5 dan) and a seasoned video editor([my studio](http://www.xianstudio.cn)).
