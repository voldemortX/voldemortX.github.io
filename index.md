I'm now a master student in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests lie in related fields of computer vision and machine learning. Currently I'm focusing on deep learning applications in vision problems with limited human interventions (semi-supervised, unsupervised, etc.), especially for autonomous driving applications (semantic segmentation, lane detection, etc.).

As for my personal life, I'm a once renowned Go player (5 dan) and a video creator ([my studio](http://www.xianstudio.cn)). I also sincerely appreciate good stories, no matter told in books, films, TV series, or any other story telling methods.
